Bokeh's JavaScript version of Kiwi
==================================

This package provides the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm
re-implemented in JavaScript so that it can be used for computing
layouts in client-side web applications like Bokeh. This version 
started from the nucleic/kiwi C++ implementation of the algorithm, 
but is now pure JavaScript.
